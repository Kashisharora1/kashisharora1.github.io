<b><a> [1] Microfoundations of Link Formation In Supply Networks </a> </b>

 <div style="background-color:WhiteSmoke;padding:3%;margin-left: 2.6%"> Supply networks are endogenous constructs shaped by firms' strategic decisions under economic incentives and frictions. Credible empirical research on non-experimental networks therefore requires carefully modeling how supply networks form. In this paper, we examine how and why links form in supply networks and their implications for network evolution. We begin by noting the challenges in estimating drivers of network formation—data sparsity at the dyad level, dependence across dyads, endogeneity, and the computational burden of vast graph spaces. Traditional approaches to model supply network formation like edge-independent models (e.g., Erdős–Rényi, random geometric graphs) miss interdependencies such as capacity constraints and signaling, while preferential-attachment models introduce dependence but lack firm agency and exogenous heterogeneity. To overcome these gaps, we develop a dynamic, random-utility framework that (a) microfounds link formation on exogenous (productivity, geography, size) and endogenous (local structure, homophily) forces, (b) allows correlated decisions across dyads, and (c) is estimated on temporal firm-to-firm data from FactSet Revere. We employ progressively sophisticated approaches—a dyad probit with correlated random effects, network instruments for endogeneity, and a structural dynamic model distinguishing formation/dissolution—to address selection, endogeneity, and non-independence. Our results show that both supplier and buyer productivity raise formation probabilities, with buyer productivity being more influential; link initiation is primarily buyer-driven and more likely after buyer-side shocks; familiarity via shared partners increases formation with diminishing returns that plateau around five partners; geographic proximity aids formation; and dissimilar firm sizes are more likely to match. Using the model, we perform counterfactuals (like reducing distance frictions by upgrading freight infrastructure and enhancing supplier productivity through state-targeted productivity programs like the semiconductor push in Arizona) showing how they rewire clusters in the network and boost productivity. To our knowledge, this is the first operations-management study to estimate supply-network formation at scale, offering a tractable framework that addresses selection and endogeneity and yields actionable guidance for managerial search and brokerage.

<b><a>[2] A Structural Analysis of Freight Delays in the Indian Railway Network </a>	</b>

 <div style="background-color:WhiteSmoke;padding:3%;margin-left: 2.6%"> Despite being one of the most cost-effective and sustainable modes for transporting freight, railways globally have been rapidly losing market share in the in-land freight transportation sector. One of the salient reasons for this is the extremely slow speed of freight trains in many parts of the world. For example, in Indian Railways, the world's fourth-largest in size, the average freight train speed is only around 25 kmph and has remained constant for the past few decades. The slow pace of freight trains is because passenger trains, which share the same infrastructure, get prioritized in dispatch by railway traffic managers (also known as section controllers). In this paper, we empirically study freight delays in the Indian railway setting by analyzing how section controllers make freight train stop and hold decisions while managing the movement of freight trains. Subsequently, we propose policies to reduce freight delays and, thus, increase trains' speed through the network. We use detailed high-frequency network congestion data and estimate a structural model to estimate the key parameters underlying the controllers' decisions. The estimated parameters provide empirical evidence for (i) the priority accorded to passenger trains over freight trains, (ii) the push effects in the freight train queue, and (iii) the strategic behavior of section controllers in holding trains at larger stations. Using the estimated model, we conduct a set of counterfactual analyses to address the problem of slow freight train speeds. First, we evaluate the impact of constructing Freight Only Corridors (FOCs), high-capacity corridors reserved for freight transport. We find that the FOCs lead to about a 29% reduction in freight train delays and a 12% improvement in train speeds. Then, we also evaluate non-capacity-investment-based alternatives to FOCs, like (i) threshold-based releases for freight trains dwelling longer than a specified time limit and (ii) freight capacity consolidation by using vertically stacked trains. Interestingly, we find that our non-capacity interventions can provide benefits similar to those of FOCs while being considerably cheaper. Specifically, a 45-minute threshold release policy leads to around 31% reduction in dwell times and 9% increase in speeds. Similarly, vertically consolidating freight capacity by about 25% leads to around a 10% increase in speed, comparable to the improvement achievable with the FOC. Our policy recommendations for improving freight speeds could enhance the overall efficiency of India's transportation infrastructure, benefiting the country's economic and social development.

<b><a> [3] Clustering on Parameters: Panel Data Estimation and Forecasting with Unobserved Heterogeneity </a> <span class="badge-new">New</span> </b>

 <div style="background-color:WhiteSmoke;padding:3%;margin-left: 2.6%"> We develop a parameter-driven clustering method to improve forecasting accuracy in panel data settings with short time series (small T) and many cross-sectional units (large N), a regime common in applications like retail demand forecasting, and customer and supply chain analytics. Traditional approaches struggle in these settings: unit-level models suffer from sparse data and noisy estimates, while pooling across observable characteristics fails to address unobserved heterogeneity. Our method addresses these challenges by clustering units based on estimated model parameters rather than observable characteristics, thereby capturing latent group structures without relying on predefined classifications. We formalize forecasting with latent groups as a joint clustering and parameter estimation problem. We show that this problem is NP-hard, which motivates our clustering estimator as a practical remedy. We formalize this estimator, derive its statistical properties, including bias, variance, and misclassification probabilities, and establish its asymptotic consistency as the cross-sectional dimension grows, even with fixed small T. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the estimator outperforms both individual and pooled estimators across a range of latent group configurations and approaches oracle benchmarks as T increases modestly. In two empirical applications, we apply the method to forecast firm-level retail sales and urban bike-sharing ridership in NYC, demonstrating significant gains in out-of-sample predictive accuracy. The discovered clusters group units with similar underlying dynamic structures that often cut across standard observable classifications such as industry codes or geographic boundaries. Our approach provides a flexible solution for high-dimensional forecasting tasks in operations and other fields.

<b><a> [4] Cost Shocks and Production Reorganization: Evidence from the GST Reform in India </a> <span class="badge-new">New</span> </b>

 <div style="background-color:WhiteSmoke;padding:3%;margin-left: 2.6%"> Manufacturing firms routinely face large exogenous cost shocks that fundamentally alter their cost structures. Examples of these shocks include new carbon pricing policies, tariffs, supply chain disruptions, and tax reforms. When such shocks occur, firms confront a critical operational dilemma: should they reorganize their product portfolios and production processes to minimize costs, or maintain operational continuity to preserve efficiency? This paper investigates this cost–efficiency tradeoff using India's 2017 Goods and Services Tax (GST) reform as a large-scale natural experiment. Leveraging granular plant-level data on 72,000 manufacturing facilities over nine years, we construct plant-specific measures of effective tax changes that account for both output tax-rate changes and the elimination of cascading input taxes. We find that plants facing larger tax increases systematically shift toward lower-rate product categories and away from high-rate ones. Critically, we distinguish between two adjustment strategies: reclassification—minor product modifications that preserve existing production capabilities, and reorganization—fundamental operational restructuring requiring new input portfolios. Resource-constrained plants predominantly rely on low-cost reclassification, while larger, capital-intensive plants undertake deeper reorganization. These adjustments carry significant efficiency consequences. Plants facing larger tax increases improve their labor and capital productivity, producing more output per worker and per unit of capital, yet a 10 percentage point tax increase still reduces total factor productivity by approximately 2.2 percent. The puzzle is resolved when we examine material productivity: plants facing higher taxes exhibit sharp declines in material productivity as they substitute toward lower-quality domestic inputs and adopt more materials-intensive production processes. Simultaneously, higher tax burdens improve inventory productivity, particularly for work-in-process and finished goods, as plants tighten working-capital management. Taken together, these patterns reveal a clear cost–efficiency trade-off: plants lower their effective tax and working-capital burdens through portfolio shifts, input substitution, and leaner inventories, but accept lower production efficiency as a result. Our findings provide actionable insights for managers building operational resilience and policymakers designing reforms that should account for heterogeneous firm responses and unintended consequences for efficiency and productivity.

 <div style="background-color:WhiteSmoke;padding:3%;margin-left: 2.6%"> We examine the physical anatomy of regulatory arbitrage in global supply chains. Using transaction-level
data and a novel methodology that isolates “minimal-processing” transactions from genuine exports, we find
that the rerouting of Chinese goods through Mexico increased by 75 percent following the 2018 US–China
trade war. We identify a distinct physical mechanism-logistics capacity frictions-that explains the multi-year
delay in trade adjustment. Using satellite imagery and industrial market data, we demonstrate that border
warehousing reached a “stock-out" floor in 2018, with trade adjustment only scaling in 2021 once a three-year
construction cycle delivered new capacity. Our findings demonstrate that a bystander country’s ability to
capitalize on trade diversion depends as much on localized corridor capacity as on comparative advantage.

<b><a> [1] Vertical Integration and Market Power in Supply Networks </a> </b>	
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Kashish Arora, Amandeep Singh and Mamta Sahare
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   <a> Manufacturing & Service Operations Management</a>, 2025, vol. 27, no.6, pp. 1939-1958

 <div style="background-color:WhiteSmoke;padding:3%;margin-left: 2.6%"> 
Problem Definition: Vertical integration, a strategic approach where firms control multiple stages of production and distribution, offers potential operational efficiencies and market power. While the operations management literature emphasizes its benefits for supply chain coordination, reduced transaction costs, and risk mitigation from informational asymmetries, antitrust studies raise concerns about how vertical mergers may enable dominant firms to limit competition by creating entry barriers and harming consumer welfare. Although some evidence exists for the supply chain benefits of vertical integration across several industries, empirical evidence on its anti-competitive effects remains scarce. This paper addresses this gap by examining vertical integration's impact on market competition and consumer welfare.
Methodology/Results: Following recent advances in empirical industrial organization, we estimate firms' markups using production function estimations. We compile a novel dataset on vertical integration cases using the FactSet Revere and SDC platinum databases, identifying 213 vertical mergers between firms with existing buyer-supplier relationships from 2003 to 2022. We employ a staggered difference-in-difference approach combined with instrumental variables (constructed using mutual fund stock outflow events) that create exogenous variation in firms' decisions to integrate vertically. Our analysis reveals that vertical integration increased acquiring firms' markups by 13\% and their rivals' markups by 6\%, on average. Rival firms, unlikely to benefit from merger-specific cost reductions, serve as a litmus test: markup increases among them suggest broader market price hikes, enhanced market power, greater industry concentration, and consequently, lower consumer surplus. We also document a notable upward trend in markups post-vertical mergers since 2003.
Managerial Implications: Our findings highlight the growing market power of firms post-integration and suggest a need for more stringent antitrust scrutiny, particularly given the increasing industry concentration over the past two decades. These insights are valuable for policymakers and regulators assessing high-profile vertical merger cases, as they provide empirical evidence of the anti-competitive risks associated with vertical integration. The study contributes to ongoing discussions in both operations management and antitrust fields, offering a deeper understanding of the balance between operational benefits and potential market distortions from vertical mergers.

<b><a>[2] A Structural Model of a Firm's Operating Cash Flow with Applications</a></b>

 <div style="background-color:WhiteSmoke;padding:3%;margin-left: 2.6%"> Effective management of a firm's operating cash flow is essential for supporting growth, servicing debt, and maintaining overall financial health. Mismanagement of cash flows can result in severe liquidity challenges and even business failure. However, managing operating cash flow is complex due to its intricate endogenous relationships with operational variables like sales, operating costs, inventory, payables, and the impact of exogenous macroeconomic factors on a firm. In this paper, we present a structural model of operating cash flow that untangles this endogeneity, allows us to estimate causal relationships among these variables, and provides a valuable tool for evaluating cash flow management policies. Applying our model to quarterly financial data from S\&P's Compustat database spanning from 1990 to 2020, along with macroeconomic indicators, we provide empirical evidence of the endogenous nature of cash flow with other operational variables. We then showcase the practical value of our model by (i) identifying the characteristics of structural shocks and the new equilibria they induce within the system, (ii) offering a tool for evaluating alternative managerial actions or policy decisions to counteract these shocks, (iii) predicting the impacts of macroeconomic events, such as global recessions and fluctuations in economic sentiment, on firm performance, and (iv) demonstrating superior forecasting performance compared to traditional univariate models. In summary, our structural model of operating cash flow enhances our understanding of its dynamics, enabling better-informed decision-making and more effective cash flow management in firms.

<b><a> [3]  Private vs. Pooled Transportation: Customer Preference and Design of Green Transport Policy </a> 	</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Kashish Arora, Fanyin Zheng, and Karan Girotra

 <div style="background-color:WhiteSmoke;padding:3%;margin-left: 2.6%"> Problem Definition: Large cities around the globe are facing an alarming growth in traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, to which a significant contributor in recent years are on-demand cabs operated by ride-hailing platforms. Pooled transportation options, such as shuttle services, are cheaper and greener alternatives. However, those alternatives are still new to many customers and policy makers. The design and effectiveness of their promotion policies demand careful investigation. This paper studies how we can reduce the number of on-demand cabs on the road and, therefore, their GHG emissions, by promoting the usage of pooled transportation such as shuttle services.

Practical Relevance: Reducing the number of ride-hailing vehicles on the road has become an important goal in many cities' green transport policy design. For example, cities like New York implemented congestion surcharge policies targeting ride-hailing vehicles in recent years.

Methodology: In this work, we use detailed usage data and build a structural model to study customers' preferences on price and service features when choosing between private cabs and a scheduled shuttle service.

Results: Using the estimated model, we identify and evaluate the efficacy of improving service features like reducing the walking distance to shuttle stops on customers' choices of transport and, therefore, the number of ride-hailing vehicles on the road. We find that a 20\% decrease in walking distance can reduce more than one million dollars worth of CO2 emissions, and achieve 40\% of the benefits attained by commonly adopted congestion surcharge policies. In addition, we demonstrate the implementability of walking distance reduction policies by addition of stops on existing shuttle routes.

Managerial Implications: Our findings suggest that, by changing operations levers such as service features of pooled transport, cities can achieve a substantial amount of the benefits from reducing congestion compared with congestion surcharge policies with essentially zero cost, leading to much more efficient green transport policies.

 <div style="background-color:WhiteSmoke;padding:3%;margin-left: 2.6%"> With the help of more than 700 reviewers we assess the reproducibility of nearly 500 articles published in the journal Management Science before and after the introduction of a new Data and Code Disclosure policy in 2019. When considering only articles for which data accessibility and hard- and software requirements were not an obstacle for reviewers, the results of more than 95% of articles under the new disclosure policy could be fully or largely computationally reproduced. However, for 29% of articles at least part of the dataset was not accessible to the reviewer. Considering all articles in our sample reduces the share of reproduced articles to 68%. These figures represent a significant increase compared to the period before the introduction of the disclosure policy, where only 12% of articles voluntarily provided replication materials, out of which 55% could be (largely) reproduced. Substantial heterogeneity in reproducibility rates across different fields is mainly driven by differences in dataset accessibility. Other reasons for unsuccessful reproduction attempts include missing code, unresolvable code errors, weak or missing documentation, but also soft- and hardware requirements and code complexity. Our findings highlight the importance of journal code and data disclosure policies, and suggest potential avenues for enhancing their effectiveness.
